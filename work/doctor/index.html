                <p>
The Doctor is a unofficial, non-magical utility and healing class for 5e Dungeons and Dragons. When looking at the
different character options given by the game there was nothing which filled the desire for a more realistic alternative
to healing. After looking for unofficial alternatives and being unhappy with community designs, I endeavored to create a
testament to inspiration such as the character "Croaker" from Glen Cook's The Black Company and Gothic works like Mary
Shelly's Frankenstein.
                </p>
                <p>The Doctor is designed in a similar structure to the Monk Class. The class works off two resource systems "first aid"
                and "treatment points". First Aid, is the main resource expended for healing. The ability works as a dice pool that
                scales with level similar to the Rogue Class's Sneak Attack but can only be used a number of times. The number of the
                times the Doctor can heal is more limited than other Classes but the amount is always a static, large amount in
                comparison. The Doctor uses First Aid to heal in large bursts and can expend Treatment Points to heal in smaller
                amounts. Treatments Points are a catch all resource for most over active abilities in the class and are meant to allow
                the Doctor to fulfill many of the same roles as other support classes without the use of spells and the need for players
                to track a large number of cool downs. </p>

                <p>I believe the Doctor Class provides something unique to 5e Dungeons and Dragons and has become one of my favorite
                projects. The class strengths come from a solid core identity and unique, evoking abilities which capture certain player
                fantasies. The Apothecary Subclass crafts a large number of potions and allows the player to pursue the most treasured
                substance, the elixir of life. The Surgeon is able to obtain a large amount of information by cutting apart enemies on
                and off the battlefield and can at later levels surgically implant monster parts onto their allies. The Combat Medic
                protects their allies on the front-line, giving orders and providing an supercharge similar games like Team Fortress
                2 and Overwatch.</p>
                <p>The Doctor is currently being play tested among an number of generous friends and will be soon be edited into a
                presentable format for distribution.</p>
