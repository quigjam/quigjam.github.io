                    <b>Empathic Games Initative is a student driven grant program at Michigan State Unversity's College of Communication Arts and Sciences.</b> I worked as a Gameplay programmer from the project at the end of it's development cycle. The project consisted of 
                    5 games created by Michigan State Students to provide knowledge about specific populations. The hope is awareness of these marginalized or stigmatized groups will lead to empathy. The projects were lead by students who graduated in Spring of 2020 but the games
                    were left unfinished because of the Covid-19 pandemic. I was brought on to the project to bring the games to a production ready state. 
                </p>
                <p>The games were scheduled for a showcase at the Detroit Science Museum which gave the project a timeline of one month to have the showcase ready. I worked mainly on the games "Journey into Darkness"  a game about social anxiety and "Calistenia" a game about physical exersice. The games were a particularlly challenging because they each used an unconventional control devices. <i>Journey through Darkness</i> used a fitpit monitor the player's heart rate and inhibit gameplay based on their approximate level of stress. <i>Calistenia</i> used a WII balance board  to register the player completing different exercises.</p><p>
                    <i>Journey Through Darkness</i> had to be adapted to function in a COVID friendly enviroment. The fitbit could not be used because of the possibility of transmitting the pathogen.  The solution was to use a vision library to detect the player's change in heart rate using facial features. The problem with the solution is the vison technology did not work well on people with darker skin tones which underscores the message of the project. 
                </p>
                <p><i>Calistenia</i> did not have the same hardware issues as <i>Journey Through Darkness</i> but had a number of gameplay problems. The gameplay of Calistenia focused on defeating a monster by completing different excercises. Calistenia had broken gameplay functions and incomplete character models. The game also had issues accuratly adjusting for the player's body weight. The gameplay issues were easily fixed and the code was adjusted to run a recalibration sequence when the player began the game.</p>
                <p>The COVID pandemic created unique constraints for the project. Eventually the project had to be adapted to a purely digital format. I began working on a web build of the games which could provide the thematic experience without the hardware. Due to the short timeline, the showcase had to be converted to a series of demo videos but the showcase may resume in
                person depending on the pandemic's lifespan.</p>
