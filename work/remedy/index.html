                <p><b>Remedy is a 2D platformer where you navigate levels to help troubled clients through their emotions. </b> Remedy
                    was made by a team of 5 using Unity overÂ a 1 month period.
                    The goal of the game was to combine dialogue elements with 2d platforming to create a unique experinece and
                    address serious topics of mental health. Remedy was developed by a team of 4 over a 6 week period and for Michigan
                    State University's Game Design
                    and Development program. I contributed to the project in the roles of producer and technical designer. The game was
                    awarded "Most Innovative" within the
                    class by a panel of facilty and
                    professional alumni.
                </p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="/images/gallery/fulls/Gameplay Diagram.png" alt="" /></span>
                <p>Remedy was inspired from the prompt "Chain Reaction" which the team wanted to take in an unconventional direction.
                    With Remedy we wanted to show how individuals can impact the emotions of others through actions.
                    Remedy is an gamified abstraction of the day-to-day job of a counselor who attempts to navigate the emotions of
                    their patients and positivily impact their life. Initally, the game was design to showcase a complex conversation
                    between the couselor and one patient.
                    The platforming enviroments and hazards represent different emotions the patient is experiencing. Anger is reflected
                    by a fiery, volcanic region while Saddness is a frozen landscape. The player's goal is to successfully navigate
                    through these regions and reach a piece
                    of the patients heart.</p>
                <p>As the converation evolves and the player succeeds, more emotions and heart pieces are introduced, requiring the
                    player to traverse additional obstacles to help the patient work through their emotions. For each additional
                    emotion, the player gains an additional
                    movement-based ability to aid in navigating the increasing complex levels. Anger allows the user to forcefully dash
                    in a targeted direction. Saddness allows the user to shrink themselves to avoid damage and increase speed.
                </p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="/images/gallery/fulls/First_Draft_445 (1).png" alt="" /></span>
                <p>Between each level of platforming, the player engages in a dialouge section where they exchange thoughts with their
                    patient. Based off the player's dialouge choices, the conversation evolves, uncovering different emotions.
                    The player will encounter a dialouge section three times over the course of a playthrough which translates into
                    gaining 3 abilities and having to navigate 3 regions of emotion. The emotions the player is able to experience in a
                    conversation builds off your previous choices.
                    A player will only experience fear as an emotion if they have already chosen happy and angry. The goal of branching
                    emotions is to simulate in an abstract method how complex a person's emotions can be.
                </p>
                <p> The project's scope was overly ambitious for the allotted time period and needed to be drastically rescoped.
                    Orignally the project was planed to procedurally construct each level using a number of premade sections focused on
                    specific emotions. The procedural generation was removed in
                    favor of handcrafting a smaller number of completed levels. Handcrafting levels allowed me to focus on what
                    abilities the player would have available.</p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="/images/gallery/fulls/Captur1e.PNG" alt="" /></span>
                <p>I created platforming encounters which uniquely challenged the player on each level based off the unique set of
                    abilities they had available.
                    As the player gained more abilities, I committed to increasing the difficulty of platforming. Having a difficulty
                    curve linked to progression was important to maintain a challenging experience. As the player gained more abilities,
                    their range of mobility increased which invalidated the difficulty of more linear level design.
                    Harder platforming also produced problems in the gameplay experience. The intended audience of the Remedy are people
                    who resonate with the game's serious message,
                    not hard-core platformer players. A significant number of playtesters and reviewers found the difficulty of later
                    levels frustrating and impassable. The game had a number of technical tuning issues
                    which caused additional frustration and soured the overall gameplay experience.
                </p>
                <p>Remedy was a lesson in proper scoping and playtesting. The game had a strong visual and thematic identify combined
                    with an unconventional approach to the platforming genre. However, technical issues and inconsistant difficulty
                    standards lead to a large variance
                    in player experience and overly frustrating situations. Additional play testing and dedicated time for polish would
                    have helped identify the obvious issues and increase the game's consistency.
