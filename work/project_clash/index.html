                <p>
                    <b>Project Clash is a React web application which uses the League of Legends api to analyze and visualize player data for
                    amature "Clash" tournaments.</b> I am currently working on Project Clash as a side project and moving toward a usable prototype.

                </p>
                <p>The application provides a deeper analysis of options and apptitudes both teams have using a classification system similar to pregame tools like <a href>mobalytics</a> and <a href="">porofessor</a>. The focus of Project Clash is to be a tool which provides value to low-level 5v5 play. To achieve this goal the application has to expand past providing data on player preferences to providing actionable recommadations for Clash draft phase.</p>
                <p>The draft phase is a influential and complicated part of League of Legends. In cordinated play, a team can secure a large advantage from a well planned draft. The nuances of drafting a synergistic team is something even professional teams struggle with. The goal of Project Clash's recommondations is to provide a low-level baseline for the user's draft phase.</p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="/images/gallery/fulls/clash2.PNG" alt="" /></span>
                <p>There are 151 diverse champions on League of Legends but champions can be broken down in smaller catagories to give more precise recommendations. For example, a large number of champions can be defined as mages. Those champions can be narrowed to mages who play different lanes, the range of each mage, what type of role they fill in a team, and the current strength of the individual champion, the player's general ability, and experience with the champion. Quickly we define search critera for recommendations and apply the tested knowledge on what catagories synergies together.</p>
                <p>The goal of the application is simple to understand information which provides a large amount of impact. Users will be able to easily compile desired recommendations into a digital draft notebook to use once drafting phase begins. </p>
                <p>Project Clash's alpha is currently in development as I create the interface and databases for recommendation reference</p>
