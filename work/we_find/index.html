                <p>
                    <b>We Find is a fullstack market research application using React and Django.</b>I worked on We Find as a full-stack
                    software development contractor at Shuttl.io. We Find uses a chrome plugin and web application dashboard to help
                    digital marketers survey potential influencer clients and
                    identify oppurtunties which resonate with thier audience and image.
                </p>
                <p>I worked on building up the front and back end services for WeFind dashboard. Although initally a challenge, I became
                    accustomed with creating the front end user experience and developing the api used by the application. The api
                    serviced the larger apis of facebook, twitter, instagram, youtube, snap chat, and the application's and pooled data
                    to create an influencer profile. The back end service then organized the sea of influencer data into more actionable
                    analytics such as engagement rate, audience demographics, and brand affinity.</p>
                <p> Properly building the api integration, preparing the data, and formatting the data in an appealing fashion on the
                    platform was challenging but I eventually became accustomed to pivoting between roles</p>
                <p>The application needed to scale and handle a large amount of requests from users. Since the application was using
                    third party libraries, a que system was needed to handle the api pull requests. The user datagram protocol was used
                    as the basis for building the messaging pipeline because of its ability to scale and process large amounts of data.
                </p>
                <p>Docker was used to help manage the infastructure needed to build the pipeline. When the user makes a request for an
                    influencer report, the api service will try to fulfill the request with reports available from a SQS database. If
                    the api cannot fulfill the report or the user is request an up-to-date version, the api will make a request to an
                    AWS Lambda service. The AWS Lambda service handle's the request ques and is send and recieve requests from
                    third-party apis. The pipeline is event based which cut downs on the number of requests the service needs to fulfill
                    and the implementation of AWS allows the pipeline to easily scale.</p>
                <p>While working on We Find I learned how to develop a web application from the front and backend, how to build a
                    integrated api service, and how to properly position a live service application to scale for long term growth.</p>
