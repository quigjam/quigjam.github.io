                <p><b>The Borderline Effect is a first person, 3d puzzle game made using Unity. </b>In the game you play as a bystander
                    who stumbles onto a remote testing facility. Trapped within the laboratory, you must perform a series of tests to
                    escape. The Borderline Effect's gamplay centers around a core mechanic of swapping between dimensions and
                    mainipulating objects within the enviroment. The game was a team project completed over a 5 week period
                    for Michigan State University's Game Design and Development program. I contributed to the project in the roles of
                    producer and technical designer. The game was awarded "Most Innovative" within the class by a panel of facilty and
                    professional alumni. </p>

                <p>The game was inspired by the first-person puzzle games "Portal", "Superliminal", and "Q.U.B.E". Each of these games
                    showcased how a simple mechanic could be expanded upon to
                    create complex puzzles. This formula suited the development cycle of the project, allowing the team to focus on
                    polishing a small number of mechanics within a short period. We quickly settled on the dimension swapping as a core
                    mechanic of the game. The preface was to allow the player to mainipulate and move objects within
                    two variations of an enviroment which occupied the same space.

                <p>The player can freely move between the two dimensions and mainipulate objects. The player is able to hold a single
                    object and transport it between dimensions. From these two intertwined systems, we were able to create complex
                    puzzles. </p>
                <p>​
                    As the technical designer, I was was responsible for prototyping and implementing the core mechanics within the game. I
                    created the dimension swapping mechanic which allows the player to swap between two variations of the same level.
                    The "Dimension Manager" system kept track of each possible dimension and the placement of elements within. Each
                    dimension responsiblity for its own elements but reported to the Dimension Manager when changes needed to be made.
                    The system tracked what the current dimension was, what dimension the user would swap to next, and what ever object the
                    player holding. I created the player's ability to mainipulate objects by mimicing similiar implementations from "Portal"
                    and "Superliminal".
                    When the player is holding an object and move to another dimension, the Dimension Manager handles transitioning the
                    object between dimensions and reassigning the reference to the proper dimension.</p>

                <p>​
                    The project was challenging because the gameplay depended on two co-dependant systems. The Dimension Manager had too
                    keep track of every object within the game and the pick up ability had the authority to mainpulate any of those
                    objects.
                    The relationship between the Dimension Manager and the pick up ability caused problems along early stages of the
                    project because when the Dimension Manager lost track of a single reference within the scene, the whole system would
                    collapse. The Dimension Manager breaking
                    was a fatal error because a number of smaller systems depended on the Dimension Manager supplying object data. These
                    problems were mitigated with revisions to the Dimension Manager which prevented errors with single objects from
                    effect the entire system.
                    Proper error checking and reporting was key in solving the issue, allowing developers to identify which references
                    and sub-systems were causing problems</p>
                <p>The Borderline Effect benefited from having a small amount of core mechanics. Limiting the scope to a single core
                    system allowed for gameplay to evolve from the system's behaviors. The gameplay is highly reminicant of The
                    Borderline Effect's inspirations, using simple mechanics such as buttons, switches,
                    and physics mainipulation to construct complex puzzles focused around the dimension swapping mechanic.
