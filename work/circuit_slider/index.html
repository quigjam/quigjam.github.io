<b>Circuit Slider is a 2D puzzle game made using Unity.</b>The project was developed during the International Global Game Jam
for the theme "repair". In Circuit Slider, the player takes control of a ball of a energy trying to restore power to a
broken electronic board. The game makes use of darkness to prevent the player from seeing the objects not close to the
player, forcing the players to explore the different paths of the electronic board and discover the necessary repairs
needed to progress.
</p>

<p>The player is confronted by a variety of different challenges in the form a variant Nodes and Paths. The player is
restricted to a grid based movement and between nodes. Moving onto locked Nodes bounces the player away and requires a
Key Node to activated to unlock. The player can also repair broken wires with scrap harvested from Collector Nodes.
Bridges are a variation of wire which requires power from either a Switch Node or temporary activation by a Timer Node. 
Player search the electronic board for Hub Nodes which provide light and power the area. Once all Hub Nodes are
activated, the way out of the electronic board is revealed and the level ends.</p>
<p>The project proceeded well for the 48 hours allotted. I took the role of project manager and main software developer for
the project because my group members were inexperienced in Unity. I had to repeatedly pause my own work to help and
instruct other group members. The project load was well delegated across the group and development remained agile the
majority of the jam. All of the individual components of the game were completed: camera, game controller, art,
lighting, and player, path, and node behavior.</p>

<p>The project suffered because of level design. The combination of a large map, little visibility and no concrete
direction  made the game difficult. To fix this problem, the game was scaled down to smaller levels which increased in
complexity.</p>
<p>Future additions to the game would include an improved interface, a level selector, and a system to show the
direction toward the nearest Hub Node.</p>
