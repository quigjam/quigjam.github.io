                    Inovision Inc is an industrial engineering contractor specializing in manufacturing automation. I worked with the
                    company's Research and Development team as a software development intern. I contributed to Smart
                    Inspect, a proprietary automated inspection system.
                    ​
                </p>
                <p>Smart Inspect is a design technology used to proof automobile bodies for defects in their paint jobs. The technology
                captures the automobile's body from a variety of angles to produce a digital representation of it's surface. The surface
                of the car's body is then analyzed for defects such as blemishes, scratches, or divots. After inspection, the
                automobile's body is passed down the line for adjustments based on the system's readings. </p>

                <p>    I developed a recursive factory interface for the Smart Inspect system during my time at Inovision. The interface was
                designed for factory line workers and technicians to be able to view real time information coming from the Smart Inspect
                system.
                ​</p>
                <p>​
                    The project was challenging for a number of reasons. First, factory systems are expensive and tend to be used for
                decades before retired. The system needed to be self-correcting, rely on technologies that would be available in 10-20
                years, and be built to last. Second, the system needed to be simple and display only relevant information. Factory
                employees need to be able to learn everything they need from a glance at the display. The interface should be clear when
                a problem happens and provide the information needed solve problems as quickly as possible. </p>
                <p>The interface  developed was built on two parts, a local interface and a server-side database. The local interface was
                created using a Raspberry Pi to operate as a kiosk that would not respond to user input outside turning off the machine.
                On start, the Raspberry Pi contacted a server-side database that held information on the different work stations. The
                system off-loaded as much to the server as possible for easy adjustments and minimal opportunities for user error.
                </p>
                <p>Smart Inspect systems are currently being used in automotive plants for companies such as General Motors and Tesla.</p>
